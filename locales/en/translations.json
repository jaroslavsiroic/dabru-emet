  "Home description": "The Educational and Cultural Center „Dabru Emet - Tell the Truth” was established at <a href='https://www.facebook.com/starozakonni'> the Jewish Religious Community in the Republic of Poland </a>. The Center conducts educational and cultural activities concerning the heritage and history of Reformed Communities, as well as the history of Jewish Communities with a centuries-old Jewish tradition in the Republic of Poland. We intend to conduct scientific, educational and cultural activities as well as organize information activities aimed at promoting Jewish culture. The Center will be open to cooperation and dialogue in the religious field with representatives of other faiths, while maintaining its own identity. The center will also publish books, newspapers and periodicals and run its activities through its own website. Feeling responsible for the spiritual and material past of the Jewish heritage and culture in the territory of the Republic of Poland, we will describe and publish cases of irreversible devastation and destruction of material Jewish souvenirs and property, miraculously saved from the fires of World War II. This destruction of the Heritage of Polish Jews happened after the takeover by the Union of Jewish Religious Communities in the Republic of Poland under the Act of February 20, 1997.",
